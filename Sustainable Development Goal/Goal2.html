			<h3><font color = "#B8860B">What is Goal 2?</font></h3>
  			<p>Goal 2 seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. It focuses on providing access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round for everyone, especially vulnerable populations.</p>
			
  			<h3><font color = "#B8860B">Why is it important for India?</font></h3>
  			<p>Despite being one of the largest food producers, India faces issues of malnutrition, food wastage, and unequal food distribution. Ensuring zero hunger is key to improving public health, child development, and national productivity.</p>

			<h3><font color = "#B8860B">Role of Computer Science and AI</font></h3>
  			<p>AI technologies help farmers predict crop yields, detect diseases, and decide the best time to sow and harvest using real-time weather and soil data. Drones and sensors are used to monitor crops, while data systems optimize food storage and reduce waste. These innovations make agriculture more productive and food systems more efficient.</p>
