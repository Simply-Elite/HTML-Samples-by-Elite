	  <h3><font color = "darkred">What is Goal 5?</font></h3>
	  <p>Goal 5 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to <u>achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</u>. It calls for an end to discrimination and violence, and ensures equal access to education, healthcare, employment, and political representation.</p>
	
	  <H3><font color = "darkred">Why Gender Equality Matters for India</font></H3>
	  
    <p>India faces several gender-based disparities:
    <ul>
      <li><u>Workforce participation:</u> Women's labor force participation is significantly lower than global averages.</li>
      <li><u>Education:</u> Girls face societal and infrastructural barriers, especially in rural regions.</li>
      <li><u>Representation:</u> Women hold fewer leadership roles in politics and business.</li>
      <li><u>Safety and rights:</u> Gender-based violence is still a major challenge.</li>
    </ul>
    Empowering women contributes to both social justice and economic growth.
  	</p>

  <h3><font color = "darkred">Role of Computer Science & AI</font></h3>
  
    <p>Computer Science and AI can be powerful tools for accelerating progress toward gender equality:
    <ul>
      <li><u>Data-driven policies:</u> AI analyzes gender gaps in access to jobs, education, and healthcare.</li>
      <li><u>Predictive safety tech:</u> Machine learning can help prevent gender-based violence.</li>
      <li><u>Inclusive design:</u> Ethical coding reduces bias in hiring, diagnostics, and educational platforms.</li>
      <li><u>Digital access:</u> Tech can connect women to education, entrepreneurship, and support systems.</li>
      <li><u>Amplifying voices:</u> Algorithms can uplift diverse perspectives and fight misinformation.</li>
    </ul>
