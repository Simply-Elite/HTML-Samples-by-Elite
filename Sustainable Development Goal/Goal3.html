  	<h3>What is Goal 3?</h3>
  	<p>This goal aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. It covers access to essential healthcare services, reducing child and maternal mortality, combating diseases, and promoting mental health and wellness.</p>

 		<h3>Why is it important for India?</h3>
  	<p>India has made significant progress in improving healthcare, but challenges like unequal access, disease outbreaks, and malnutrition still exist. Strengthening the healthcare system is essential to support the country's large and diverse population.</p>

  	<h3>Role of Computer Science and AI</h3>
  	<p>AI helps in early diagnosis through image recognition (like X-rays and MRIs), predicting disease outbreaks, and managing hospital data efficiently. Telemedicine and health apps allow remote consultations, especially for rural areas. Wearable tech and smart devices also track health stats and promote preventive care.</p>
